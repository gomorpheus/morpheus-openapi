  summary: Provides authentication via username and password
  operationId: getAccessToken
  description: |-
    This endpoint provides authentication via `username` and `password` of a Morpheus User. The response includes a valid access token. If your current token is expired, a new one will be created and returned.

    Subtenant users will need to pass their subdomain prefix like subdomain\username. The default subdomain is the tenant account ID.

    This endpoint also allows refreshing your current access token to get a new token. This is done by passing your current `refresh_token`. This provides a way to renew your client’s session with the API, and extend the expiration date.

    This will render your current access token invalid, so you will need to update any scripts relying on it.
