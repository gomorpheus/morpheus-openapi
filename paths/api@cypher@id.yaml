  summary: Read or Create a Cypher Key
  description: |
    This endpoint retrieves a specific cypher key. The value of the key is decrypted and returned as data. It may be a String or an object with many {"key":"value"} pairs. 
    The type depends on the cypher mount's capabilities and what type of data was written to the key. 
    For example the `secret/` mount allows either a string or an object, while the `password/` mount will always store and return a string.
    This endpoint can also create a key. This only applies to mount types `uuid`, `key`, `password`.  Refer to the `POST` endpoint for more information.

            The following parameters are available under the root context of the JSON body.
            The secret mount is capable of storing the entire JSON object as key=value pairs, or just a single string. To store a string instead, use the value query parameter instead of JSON, or pass type=string.
            There are a couple of special keys that the API will look for in the payload.
            The ttl key is a special key that if present in the payload will be parsed and used as the ttl parameter (lease duration in seconds).
            The value key is a special key that if present in the payload will be parsed and used as the secret data (instead of the entire payload). This is true when type=string.
          properties:
            ttl:
              oneOf:
                - type: string

                Time to Live. The lease duration in seconds, or a human readable format eg. 15m, 8h, 7d. The default is 0 meaning Never expires. This only is applied if the cypher does not yet exist and is created.
              default: 0

              type: string
              description: The secret value to be stored. This is only parsed if type is passed as `string`.
